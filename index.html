Damian Green's Github page
</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Damian Green! I'm the founder of the <a href="https://techguide.io">TechGuide.io</a> - a webstie about software and tech. I believe that tech and software are very simple in fact, but they get overcomplicated. Tech articles are not something that is made for tech people only - that is what I stand for.</p>
